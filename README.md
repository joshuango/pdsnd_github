# Data Exploration with US Bikeshare Data

## Project Overview
This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Here, an immersive and interactive experience is created in the terminal, allowing you to answer questions in order to personalise the data displayed.
